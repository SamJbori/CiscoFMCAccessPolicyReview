# Firepower Management Console Access Policy Review Generator
v201909.0a

Note: This is literally my first python code beside the "Hello World" and print (x + 2)!



Fixed bugs
* dealing with offset, now 1000 instead of 25
* dealing with policy inheritance, Cisco TAC promised they will figure a bug for the issue involving missing Object UUID in child Access Policy inherited from Parent Policy

The script will spit out a text document that contains a TAB separated fields, copy and paste it in excel and wallah, you got yourself a half-ass Firewall Policy Review document!


Please feel free to report bugs, suggest modification, or share your experience!
